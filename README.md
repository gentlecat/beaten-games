# Beaten Games

## Idea

This project is meant to help you keep track of games that you've already beaten. You'd create a list of games and will be able to share it with other people.

In addition to that it will be nice to be able to share some more informaton about your experience with each game. Things like score, recommendations, or just thoughs would be nice to have.

Another useful thing might be integration with Steam Web API and other interesting APIs (like one that [Giant Bomb](https://www.giantbomb.com/api/) has). Maybe even implement log in system using OAuth with Steam, pull some data about games if it is available.

## Goal

This is [my](https://roman.zone) side project that I'm doing for fun. Trying to solve problem that I have and learn something new while I'm working on that. This project is completely open source.
